# the standard deviation is the value that tells how much the values in the data are far apart from each other

import numpy as np

data = [32,111,138,28,59,77,97]

print(np.std(data))


# variance is also like standard deviation just the method is different, std = sqrt(variance)

print(np.var(data))
